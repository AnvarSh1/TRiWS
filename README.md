Tandem Repeats in Weighted Sequences

MSc Individual Project at King's College London 


"Tandem repeat is a consecutively repeated string which is not empty. For e.g. www, 0101, and

TAGCTAGC. Any string containing such repeated sequences as a substring is called repetition-containing;

otherwise, a string is repetition-free (Barton et al., 2014). A tandem repeat in this case, is a string of the

form , where  is a non-empty string (Barton et al., 2014). Considering some string x, questions

regarding tandem repeats in x may arise. For e.g. if x contains tandem repeats and a possible number of

such repetitions, it has been demonstrated by Crochemore (1981) that there exists a chance of having O

(n log n) maximal repetitions within a string of length n. Eventually, Kolpakov and Kucherov (1999) devised

an O (n) time algorithm to calculate the compact representation for all such repetitions denoted by runs.

Usually, these algorithms work on regular strings. We will currently focus on locating tandem repeats in

weighted sequences. The first step is to understand what a weighted sequence is. A weighted sequence

may be defined as a type of string that allows characters of a given alphabet to occur at a particular

position with respective probability, unlike fixed single characters in a normal string. This model allows us,

among other things, to use the idea of equivalence classes in weighted sequences, introduced by Zhang,

Guo and Iliopoulos (2012) to calculate tandem repeats of all possible lengths."
